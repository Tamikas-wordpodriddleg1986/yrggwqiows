Just walked out of that... the theater, Thudarum or whatever it was called. My head’s still spinning, popcorn everywhere (ugh) and people just chattering. Like being in the middle of a bird market at dawn. Why are theaters always like this?? Did anyone else feel the ear-numbing explosion in the third act?? My back is killing me, damn these seats. Should’ve stretched.

Anyway, the  ... wow. Thudarum. Starts like a gentle 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 then BAM — like a catapult launching dictionaries at you. What even was that opening scene?? So much blue. Blue everywhere, like a smurf rave. Skipping through timelines like I'm skipping ads on a 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 app — the scene where the main guy, Raj? or was it Ram? whatevs, pulls off that heist, with such coolness. Like a squirrel sneaking past a hawk (do they do that?)

>The part with the grandmother and the time-traveling beetle — should that even make sense? It's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone paint a room without a brush. Felt oddly touching tho. Everyone went silent suddenly, a phone rang — embarrassing!!

Also, someone remind me... did anyone ever find out where the missing unicorn went?? Or was it just me imagining things again?? Gosh, sometimes these 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 blend into my dreams. So many chase scenes, and everything being done backward, like they went to great lengths to be weirdly cool. Reminded me of that'd time I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 my neighbor mow the lawn backward (still confused).

Right — someone asked if you could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for later, and I'm thinking, yeah, probably, but like, half the fun's 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this jumbled mess unfold onscreen, ya know? That epic conclusion with the bridge and stuff falling — sheer chaos. One guy even screamed porridge!! don't even know why.

Then bam. End credits roll, lights flickering but it's like I’m still there in those lil’ pixelated moments, heart racing as if I’d run a marathon or just eaten an entire cheesecake by myself. A taste of mystery, a dash of ‘what just happened’. You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   to get what I mean, or maybe not. Highly recommend experiencing the confusion live.
